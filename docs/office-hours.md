title: Office Hours

This is a checklist to help with preparing the [Koor Office Hours meeting](https://github.com/koor-tech/koor#office-hours).

Each occurence of the meeting needs to have at least one person responsible for it.
We use the "Planning + Retro" meeting to decide who is available to prepare the next office hours meeting.
