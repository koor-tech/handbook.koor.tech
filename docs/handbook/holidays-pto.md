title: Holidays & Paid Time Off
---

### Paid time off

What matters most is your results, which are driven by your focus, your availability to collaborate, and the time and consideration you put into your work. Koor Technologies, Inc. offers all team members unlimited time off. Whether you want to take a trip, you are eager for some time to relax, or you need to get some chores done around the house, any reason is a good reason for personal time. For team members working in jurisdictions that require certain mandatory sick leave or PTO policies, Koor Technologies, Inc. complies to the extent required by law.

### Taking time off

When you take any time off, you should follow this process:

- Let your manager and team know as soon as possible. (e.g., post a message in your team's Slack channel)
- Find someone to cover anything that needs covering while you're out. (i.e., meetings, planned tasks, unfinished business, important Slack/email threads, anything where someone might be depending on you)
- Mark an all-day "out of office" event in Google Calendar for the day(s) you're taking off.

This process is the same for any days you take off, regardless of whether it's a holiday or you just need a break.

### Holidays

At Koor Technologies, Inc., we have team members with various employment classifications in many different countries around the world. Koor Technologies, Inc. is a US company, but we think you should choose the days you want to work and what days you are on holiday, rather than being locked into any particular nation or culture's expectation about when you should take time off.

When a team member joins Koor Technologies, Inc., they pick one of the following holiday schedules:

- Based on the country where you work. Non-US team members should let their managers know the dates of national holidays.
  or
- No set schedule, start with no holidays and add the days that are holidays to you.

Either way, it's up to you to ensure that your responsibilities are covered, and your team knows that you're out of office.

#### COMPANY HOLIDAY - Christmas Week Off

Starting on December 24th, Koor Technologies, Inc. enjoys a company Christmas Holiday Week. We close our offices for the week so people can take this time to rest and celebrate the holidays, and focus on their loved ones.

Please remember to update PTO by Roots and select Christmas Holiday Week.

For Support during the holiday, please refer to the [2021 Holidays On Call Schedule][44]

#### 2021 End of Year Celebration - *Time extended through \[date\]*

The end of year is a natural time for celebration and togetherness. For many companies, an "end of year party" is a time to be together with coworkers and to share the experience with significant others. We also want these qualities, but as an all-remote company, take a different approach.

We ask that each team member have a special celebratory dinner with their family or close friends, courtesy of Koor Technologies, Inc., and then share pictures and stories from the experience with us in the #celebrations Slack channel. We hope this will help each person enjoy the festive spirit with their loved ones, and for us all to get to know one another better through the stories.

Look for this invitation is Slack:

#### COMPANY HOLIDAY - Spend the day with your Family and Friends

At Koor Technologies, Inc., we value family and friends. In an ongoing pandemic with COVID-19 affecting many of our team members, we want to ensure that people are making their well-being a top priority and that we are living out our values, to emphasize this we will coordinate a Quarterly "Family and Friends Day" for as long as the majority of the world, where our team members reside, are dealing with COVID-19. On this day, we will close the doors to the Tilig virtual office, reschedule all meetings, and have a **publicly visible shutdown**.

Team members can share about their Family and Friends Day in the #family-and-friends-day Slack channel after the event, or publicly on social media such as Twitter, LinkedIn, or wherever they're most comfortable using the hashtag #FamilyFriends1st. Sharing is optional. Taking the day off is strongly encouraged if your role allows it.

#### Upcoming Family and Friends Days

2. TODO

We will look at scheduling future dates roughly quarterly. In line with our Paid Time Off policy, we encourage Koor Technologies, Inc. Team Members to continue to take additional days off as needed. Family and Friends Day is a reminder to do this.

#### FAQ about Family and Friends Day

#### Who determines upcoming Family and Friends Days?

Any Koor Technologies, Inc. team member is able to propose a Family and Friends Day. To propose a Family and Friends Day please follow the steps outlined below:

1. Review the Koor Technologies, Inc. Team Meetings calendar for major conflicts, review major holidays, and avoid scheduled Investor calls and Customer Council Meetings.
2. Submit a request to peopleops@koor.tech

#### I'm in a role which requires me to work that day. How can I still benefit from this initiative?

If you are in a role that requires you to work on Family and Friends Day, you can work with your manager to find an alternative day. We encourage you to consider the following business day as the preferred second choice for a day away, but do what works best for you and your team.

#### What if the date is a public holiday or non-working day in my country? How does this apply to me?

We encourage you to take off the next working day. If this day isn't an option, work with your manager to find another day that works for you and your team.

#### How is this any different than our vacation policy?

Nothing about our Paid Time Off policy is changing. We wanted to designate a specific day in order to more proactively force a pause for team members. If most of the company isn't working, there is less pressure for you to do so.

#### What about client or prospect meetings that conflict?

If you feel that this meeting can be rescheduled without any setbacks to the business, please go ahead and do so. If you have a meeting that would be hard to reschedule or would jeopardize the business results, please work with your manager to find another day that would work for both you and your team.

#### What if I'm out sick on either of those days?

Feel better! Please work with your manager to find another day that works for you and your team.

#### How do I communicate that I'm off that day?

We'll assume that most people are off on Family and Friends Day, but we know that some people will take other days.

Please update PTO by Roots in Slack. You can select Create an OOO Event and find Family and Friends Day in the drop-down menu of What type of OOO is this?.

Feel free to block your calendar with "Family and Friends Day" to share whatever day you take.

### Work Availability and Paid Time Off

We emulate GitLab's "don't ask, must tell" policy, and encourage people to take the time off. It's up to each teammate to choose what days will work best for them, but we generally encourage you to take your national Holidays, in addition to some long weekends and vacations.

#### How to Take Time Off

You can take time off whenever you want. However, please be responsible in when you take it and how you communicate it. Here are a few things to consider:

1. Check with your manager to try to avoid being out around a critical milestone or at the same time that others on your team will be out
2. Try to provide advance notice \-- a general guideline would be to share twice as many days in advance as you'd like to take off. e.g. two days' notice is for one day off; two weeks in advance would be better if you want to take a full week.
    - Note that this does not apply for emergencies, and is not a requirement. Sometimes fun things come up last minute that you want to do. But this guideline will help prevent leaving others in the lurch when you have some flexibility in scheduling.
3. Team members who are with us through an agency should also follow that agency's procedures in addition to ours.
4. If you will miss the sprint video update, please record one in advance so that others will be aware of what you contribution during the sprint
5. Being part of a global remote team means you need to be highly organized and a considerate team player. Each team has busy times so it is always a good idea to check with them to ensure there is adequate coverage in place.
6. Engineers should ensure the following are in place before going on leave:
    - All tickets assigned to you are completed, verified and closed
        - If there are pending tickets, discuss with an engineer who can take up while you are gone
    - There are no merged requests assigned to you that are not merged
    - If you are taking a longer leave, communicate with the team few days prior to your leave

#### How to Add Bulk Time Off

We encourage you to take the national holidays in your home country. We've made this easy by providing a calendar with those dates so that you can add them in bulk.

1. Visit our [Important Dates Spreadsheet][47] and see the tab for your National Holidays
2. Create a local CSV file of that tab, using the menu option File: Download: CSV.
    - After you create a copy, feel free to add or remove dates as fit to your circumstances
    - Note that holidays that occur on weekdays have start and end times, so that importing them will block off your calendar
    - [More instructions][48] are available from Google
3. Import into your Google Calendar using its Settings: Import & export feature
4. Confirm it added the dates properly

Note that you should notify your manager when you opt which dates to take and if you made an deviations from these defaults. It's not necessary to email all@ if you use these default dates.

#### Absenteeism

Our time off policy is flexible, but requires proactive communication. Any team member who takes 3 consecutive days without prior notification will be considered to have voluntarily resigned.

If someone is absent, the manager will make effort to contact the team member or someone listed as their emergency contact. Please share [emergency contact information via this form][49] with people-ops, so that we know who to call in case of an unexpected absence.

Managers can find information on who to call in our [Emergency Contact Information Sheet][50]

#### Communicating Your Time Off

Once you've decided to take time off and your manager is aware, it should be communicated to the rest of the team. Here's how:

1. Mark the time as Out of office on your calendar.
    1. Select the Automatically decline new and existing meetings option so that your meeting status will show "declined"
2. You should add the time off using PTO by Roots to Slack. Please use the following syntax which uses the [ISO 8601][9] date notation in order to avoid confusion: OOO from YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD, please contact XXX for assistance.
3. Email \[insert group email\] with the dates you will be away (this is not necessary for National holidays planned in advance; see below for that process)
4. If you won't check email at all, add an out-of-office response in your email settings with the start and end date of your time off so that people reaching out to you on email will be notified
5. It may be useful to share your planned time off as a **FYI** on your team's Slack channel(s), especially if you lead a team.

#### PTO by Roots

[PTO by Roots][51] allows employees and managers to coordinate time off seamlessly with intuitive Slack commands. The integration from Slack automatically monitors PTO balances and takes action. PTO by Roots also reminds employees of their upcoming time off and helps them assign roles and tasks for co-workers, giving all parties involved greater alignment and peace of mind.

[PTO by Roots Training Video][52]

Please be aware that new team members' PTO by Roots accounts are activated and synced automatically once a day, so if you try to access PTO by Roots on your first day and receive an error message, please attempt to access PTO by Roots on Day 2. If you still receive an error message, let your assigned People Ops Specialist know in your onboarding issue.

If you receive an error message **"Uh-oh! It doesn't look like you have access to PTO by Roots"** please attempt the following steps.

1. Check to see if your email address (Koor Technologies, Inc.) in your slack profile matches your email address.
2. If these two are not the same exact email then the application will not recognize you as a team member.
3. If these two are the same, please reach out in the #peopleops channel.

## Parental Leave

Koor Technologies, Inc. offers anyone (regardless of gender) who has been at Koor Technologies, Inc. for six months up to 16 weeks of 100% paid time off during the first year of parenthood. This includes anyone who becomes a parent through childbirth or adoption. The paid time off is per birth or adoption event, and may be used only within the first 12 months of the event.

We encourage parents to take the time they need. Koor Technologies, Inc. team-members will be encouraged to decide for themselves the appropriate amount of time to take and how to take it.

### New Parent Leave

Koor Technologies, Inc. gives new parents six weeks paid leave. After six weeks, if you don't feel ready to return yet, we'll set up a quick call to discuss and work together to come up with a plan to help you return to work gradually or when you're ready.

### How to Initiate Your Parental Leave

Some teams require more time to put a plan of action in place so we recommend communicating your plan to your manager at least 3 months before your leave starts. In the meantime, familiarize yourself with the steps below:

To initiate your parental leave, submit your time off by selecting the Parental Leave category in PTO by Roots at least 30 days before your leave starts. We understand that parental leave dates may change. You can edit your PTO by Roots at a later time if you need to adjust the dates of your parental leave. It's important that you submit a tentative date at least 30 days in advance. Your manager will get notified after you submit your leave and will send you an e-mail within 48 hours confirming that they've been notified of your Parental Leave dates.

Please note, even though we have a "no ask, must tell" Paid Time Off Policy, it's important that your Team Head is aware of your leave **at least 30 days before your leave starts.**

### Planning Your Parental Leave Dates

Your 16 weeks of parental leave starts on the first day that you take off. This day can be in advance of the day that the baby arrives. You don't have to take your parental leave in one continuous period, we encourage you to plan and arrange your Parental Leave in a way that suits you and your family's needs. You may split your Parental Leave dates as you see fit, so long as it is within the 12 months of the birth or adoption event.

If you don't meet the initial requirements for paid leave, Koor Technologies, Inc. payroll coverage begins once you meet the requirements. Until then, you will not receive pay. If for example, you are someone who qualifies after 6 months at Koor Technologies, Inc. and then goes on leave at the start of your 120th day at Koor Technologies, Inc., you would not receive payment from Koor Technologies, Inc. for the first 60 days. You would receive payment from Koor Technologies, Inc. for up to 60 additional days taken within a year from the birth event.

You can change the dates of your parental leave via PTO by Roots. Your Team Head will receive a notification every time you edit your Parental Leave dates. Make sure your leave is under the Parental Leave category, otherwise your Team Head won't get a notification.

Please note, if you are planning to change or extend your Parental Leave by using a different type of leave such as PTO, unpaid leave or any local statutory leave, please send an e-mail to your Team Head.

### Administration of Parental Leave Requests

For Your Team Head:

- PTO by Roots will notify Your Team Head of any upcoming parental leave.
- Notify the team member that the parental leave request was received by sending a confirmation e-mail. .
- PTO by Roots will automatically update the employment status.
- Check if the team member has confirmed their return via email. If not, send the Return to Work e-mail to the team member and manager.
- Do a weekly audit of parental leave return dates. If a team member hasn't sent an e-mail within 3 days of returning, send them the return to work e-mail, copying the manager in.
