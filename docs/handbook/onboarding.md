## Welcome to Koor Technologies, Inc.!

#### Onboarding a new advisor

Advisor agreements are sent through [DocuSign][62], using the "Advisor Agreement" template. To send a new advisor agreement, you'll need the new advisor's name, and the number of shares they are offered. Once the agreement is sent, add a new row to the [advisory board spreadsheet][66] and enter the new advisor's information. Use this spreadsheet to track the advisor's progress through the onboarding process.

**Note**: Be sure to mark any columns that haven't been completed yet as "TODO"

When the agreement is completed, make sure it is in the correct Google Drive folder, and ask the new advisor to add us on [Linkedin][67], [Crunchbase][68] and [Angellist][69].

### Onboarding process

Welcome to the team!

Before you join, your manager should create an onboarding ticket in GitLab. To do this:

1. Go to [Onboarding Process](onboarding.md)
2. Create a Title of "Onboarding \-- \<employee_name\>"
3. Select Choose a template next to "Description"
4. Select the New Teammate Onboarding template. This template has todos for the new teammate, for their manager, and to help set up the proper administrative needs.
5. Schedule a daily check-in for each day of the first two weeks. Add [this document][70] as the notes for the agenda

### Schedule

Your first week will be "company onboarding", led by CEO and PeopleOps/or designee, and your second week will be "role onboarding," led by your manager.

In week 1, we will cover these topics:

1. Company Overview
2. Values
3. Communications
4. Meeting norms
5. Handbook-first process and training on its first use cases
6. What's novel / uncommon about Koor Technologies, Inc. practices
7. Go through expectations of your workstation setup, review Finance processes & People Group - Led by PeopleOps, make sure you complete the [Emergency Contact Form][71]
8. Meet the Team - [Welcome to Koor Technologies, Inc. - All Team Members Call TODO]

In week 2, you will work with your manager to:

1. Learn about our customer council process and review the latest slides from that page \-- this will give you an update on our last strategic input from them
2. Review our company goals and draft personal goals for yourself for 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months if it's helpful
3. Define your personal goals
4. Understand your role and responsibilities

### Administrative Needs

With each teammate we welcome, we learn a bit more about how to bring people onboard. As we learn, we update the template that we use, which is located in the Handbook source code at .gitlab/issue_templates/New Teammate Onboarding.md. Onboarding applies to full-time team members as well as part-time team members.

### Relocation Expenses

If you're moving for work, Koor Technologies, Inc. will pay relocation costs subject to pre-approval on the amount by your manager.

### New Teammate Welcome Call

When a new teammate joins, we take the opportunity for the whole company to come together and welcome them to the team. Like the Biweekly Team call, this call is different than all other Koor Technologies, Inc. meetings because it is mostly focused on the team we're building, not our product or programs or customer relationships. We do this ritual to celebrate the growth of our team, to reflect back on how we've grown over time and how every single new person has changed the trajectory of our company, to form new relationships among ourselves and to help everyone know the newest member of the Koor Technologies, Inc. team.

- We use our [all-team notes document][72] to guide the conversation
- We go through in order of Start Date from our [Team Milestones][73]
- Each person introduces themselves, explains their role, and shares some tidbit about themselves (which changes for each meeting).
- Each person then calls on the next teammate on the list.
