### Stipend for non-US team members

The stipend is intended to make it easy for you and for the company to administer the benefits. Thus we've made a "default" of the payment amount listed above, which can be increased upon request and with showing appropriate receipts. To receive the default amount you don't need to do anything; it will be included by default in your monthly paycheck.

If this does not cover your monthly expenses, you may opt to share the details of your expenses, and we will adjust your stipend accordingly. To do this, please share the following information with \[insert group email\]:

1. Your healthcare bill. We'll calculate the stipend based on 100% for team members and 66% for dependent.
2. Your internet bill
3. Any other recurring expenses that are aligned with our policies.

We'll recalculate and adjust your default monthly stipend accordingly.

For countries where health plans must be paid upfront for the year, we will be pay 100% for team members and 66% for dependent upfront. The upfront amount paid will be deducted from the yearly total stipend amount. The remainder will be divided by 12 to calculate the monthly stipend amount. The new monthly stipend will be disbursed monthly.

For example: If an insurance requires to pay $1500 upfront for an individual, Koor Technologies, Inc. will pay $1500 upfront (100% of $1500). The monthly stipend will be $3600 (yearly stipend) minus $1500 ( what Koor Technologies, Inc. paid) divided by 12. In this case it would be $175.
