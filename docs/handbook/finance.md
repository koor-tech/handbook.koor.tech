### Fixed Assets Tracking

- Fixed assets such as office furniture, computer equipment, laptops, are purchased for long-term use. They usually have a useful life of more than one year. Koor Technologies, Inc. tracks its fixed assets with a unit price over $500 USD via this document \[insert Employee Equipment - Fixed Asset Tracking\].
- The purchaser of the assets is required to log in to this file to fill out the information (as indicated in the file), such as date of purchase, purchaser's name, the value of the asset, etc.
- Any team members who received the company purchased laptops or computer equipment are required to log in to this file and fill out the asset description, model #, and serial #.
- Please make sure the information of the Fixed Asset Tracking file is completed (**within 7 business days**) of the purchase date when the asset is initially purchased.
- If a transition happens from existing computer equipment to another team member, the recipient of the computer equipment is required to acknowledge the receipt of the computer equipment (**within 7 business days**). Please log in to the Fixed Asset Tracking file and fill out the required information (as indicated in the file), such as the description of the asset transition, date of transition, old owner, new owner, etc.
- **Purchasing Company Assets that are no longer used for Business**
    If an employee is interested in buying a company asset that is no longer used for business, the CEO will review case by case, with consideration to whether an asset can be used again, value to the company, and define a fair market value for sell. CEO should notify Accounting immediately if a decision is made to allow an employee to purchase the company's assets, so Accounting can make sure this is recorded properly.

- Please DO NOT submit invoices and/or payment instructions via GitHub, GitLab, 1Password, etc.

- In general, invoices up to $5000 can either be approved by CTO or CEO.
- Invoices over $5000 require CEO approval
- **Project Related Invoice Approval**. For Project-related invoices, ONLY the Head of Engineering team approves the bill in Bill.com. The CTO and the CEO can approve the payment in SVB for wires.
- The Head of Engineering and Accounting can review and validate the spending according to the Project budget periodically. However, all Project-related bills will need the Head of Engineering to approve in Bill.com to enable proper internal control.

### Invoice Receiving Acknowledgement and Documentations (Accounting's Responsibilities)

- Process invoices received in accounting@koor.tech in Bill.com and route the invoices for approval in Bill.com according to the Invoice Approval Hierarchy.
- The AP accountant will reply to the `accounting@koor.tech` and the vendor to acknowledge that the invoice has been processed in Bill.com. The turnaround time is usually 1-2 business days from the day the invoice is submitted to Accounting and the acknowledgment.
- AP Accountant needs to make sure to use the contractor's contact email to send out bill.com e-invite (do not use the contractor's Koor Technologies, Inc. email). This will help us to make sure the applicable contractors can receive their tax forms even if they are no longer working with Koor Technologies, Inc.
- For US vendors, upload a copy of W-9 in Bill.com under the Document section
- For non-US vendors, upload a copy of [W-8BEN Form](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw8ben.pdf) in Bill.com under the Document section

### Invoice Payments

### Bill.com Payments

- Once an invoice is approved, payment is usually processed based on Net 30 payment terms unless otherwise specified in an agreement or invoice
- Bill.com e-payment is recommended to pay all vendors
- How Bill.com e-payment works?
    - To establish Bill.com e-payment, Accounting will send an e-invite to an email that is provided by the vendor. The vendor accepts the invite and provides their bank information within Bill.com. The payment will be scheduled to deposit to the vendor's account according to the payment terms. E-payment will usually arrive in the recipient's account within 2-4 business days.

**Exception:** For some non-US vendors who may have difficulties setting up a Bill.com e-payment, a wire payment will be processed.

### Wire Payments

All wires from SVB are initiated by Accounting and approved by Koor Technologies, Inc. authorized SVB signer(s) per the authorization that is set up with SVB.

#### Wire requestor's responsibilities:

1. Make sure the vendor provides all the required information as outlined below before requesting a wire payment
2. For a new vendor's 1st payment, please send an email to accounting@koor.tech with invoices, wire instructions, Form W-8BEN-E (if non-US vendors). For the 2nd payment and onward, send invoice only is okay unless the vendor requests any changes, such as bank changes
3. Make sure the vendor provides a formal invoice. (A quotation and/or a Pro Forma Invoice cannot be accepted to issue a payment) Exceptions should be discussed with the CTO or CEO and Accounting.
4. For non-US vendors, make sure the invoices indicate the proper currency Wire payment is used to pay any vendors who cannot get paid via Bill.com or to provides funds to **non-US team members** for business expenses. To request a wire payment, please send an email request to accounting@koor.tech along with:
5. The invoice to be paid
6. Vendor's wire instructions - see below-requested information about wire instructions
7. If a foreign currency wire payment is required, please indicate which currency
8. If a wire payment needs to arrive by a certain date, please be very specific about it so Accounting can plan accordingly
9. A brief description for the Purpose of Payment (per bank requirement for international wires)
10. **Bank Fees** If any bank fees that Koor Technologies, Inc. should be covering to ensure the recipient can receive the full payment, please notify Accounting about how much bank fees to add to the wire total as the fees can vary vendor by vendor. For example, some Zambia vendors don't need Koor Technologies, Inc. to include any bank transfer charges, some of them do. Given each vendor's situation is different, Accounting requests vendors to provide how much bank fee to include and in what currency with the 1st payment request. For future recurring payments, Accounting can include the same amount of bank fees without asking again unless new changes are provided by the vendor and the amount of change is justified by Accounting.
    Typically, a wire instruction needs to include below:
    1. Recipient's name
    2. Recipient's address
    3. Recipient's bank name
    4. Recipient's bank address
    5. Recipient's bank account
    6. Recipient's bank ABA Routing Numbers (if domestic wire within the United States)
    7. Recipient's IBAN, BIC, or SWIFT Code (if international bank outside of United States)
    - Sometimes the bank may require to provide additional information, Accounting will reach out to the wire requestor if such request arises. \*
    - Wire payment is usually quicker, but for international wire payment, it still takes a few business days to clear. We suggest you submit the wire request at least 7 business days prior to the payment due date to allow accounting to get the wire initiated and approved.
    - If the wire payment is urgent, please flag "**URGENT Payment Request**" in the subject line when you send the wire request to accounting@koor.tech. Please don't submit a payment request via a Gitlab ticket as it can easily be buried in the thread.
    - If the wire payment is recurring, please send the invoice that needs to be paid to Accounting and indicates this is a recurring payment with no wire instruction change. Please be specific if the wire needs to arrive by a certain date so Accounting can plan the wire accordingly.
11. Once a wire payment is initiated and approved, the controller will send a proof of payment to the wire requestor in the following business day or when such document becomes available in SVB. When the controller is not available, such as on vacation, the \[designee\] will provide such proof of payment.

### Payroll

- Payroll for US-based full-time employees is managed via Gusto.
- Koor Technologies, Inc. runs a semi-monthly payroll schedule.
- US Employees will complete the onboarding process through Gusto and set up direct deposits for their payroll payments.

### Contracted Non-US Team Members

- For contracted **non-US team members**, a completed W-8BEN Form is collected during the [Pilot](#pilot) onboarding process.
- Payments related to the contracted services are usually processed in [Pilot](#pilot) monthly.
- Expense reimbursement reports from the **non-US team members** are required to submit in Expensify.

Please refer to the Expense Reports and Pilot sections below for more details.

### Pilot

Koor Technologies, Inc. uses [Pilot](https://pilot.co/) to process payments for **non-US team members.**

When a team member successfully completes the onboarding process, the direct manager of the new hire should notify Accounting immediately via sending an email to [accounting@koor.tech](mailto:accounting@koor.tech) with the information below:

- Full name of the new hire
- Official start date
- Annual or monthly compensation in USD$
With the new hire's information, Accounting will help to pre-generate the monthly invoices for the next 12 months on behalf of the new hire. If there are any exceptions on this, please notify Accounting by sending an email to [accounting@koor.tech](mailto:accounting@koor.tech).

Since the team members in Pilot are mostly based outside of the US and the processing time of non-US payment varies, Accounting has developed a monthly payment calendar to streamline the payment schedule and to allow the funds to arrive on or before the last day of each month.

For new hires who joined on or before the 22nd of a given month, Accounting will try to include the new hire in the monthly payment schedule. If a new hire joined after the 22nd of a given month, Accounting may need to run an off-cycle payment for the new hire. Accounting will notify the new hire when the payment will arrive in the situation of an off-cycle payment.

If you have any questions or concerns about the status of your payment, please contact [accounting@koor.tech](mailto:accounting@koor.tech).
