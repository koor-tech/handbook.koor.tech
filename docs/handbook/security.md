## Security Guidelines

### General Guidelines

* Use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) or Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) whenever available, for more information [Two-Factor Authentication section](#two-factor-authentication).
* Use encryption for your company devices (e.g., company laptop must be encrypted with a password or other token).

### Engineers, Developers and Administrators Guidelines

* Use [Cloudflare Zero Trust](https://dash.teams.cloudflare.com/c41a09302d93e4fd0bb15a58fabfe0f8/home) Single-Sign-On (SSO) where applicable and available.

## Two-Factor Authentication

You can either put Two-Factor into our company password store tool or on your smartphone using a TOTP/HOTP app.

If you want to put the second factor on your smartphone, we recommend the following app: [https://github.com/beemdevelopment/Aegis](https://github.com/beemdevelopment/Aegis).
(Please ensure that you have an encrypted backup of whatever Two-Factor app you are using)

Google account Two-Factor settings can be found here: [https://myaccount.google.com/signinoptions/two-step-verification](https://myaccount.google.com/signinoptions/two-step-verification).
(For Google accounts, the "Google prompts" two-factor is also okay)
