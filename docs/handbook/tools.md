## Productivity Tools

## Explained

### Slack

At Koor Technologies, Inc., we do not send internal emails to each other. Instead, we prefer to use Slack to communicate with other folks who work at Koor Technologies, Inc.

We use threads in Slack as much as possible. Threads help limit noise for other people following the channel and reduce notification overload.

We configure our working hours in Slack to ensure everyone knows when they can get in touch with others.

#### Slack channels

We have specific channels for various topics, but we also have more general channels for the teams at Koor Technologies, Inc.

We use these prefixes to organize the Koor Technologies, Inc. Slack:

- *g-*: for team/group channels. *(**Note**: "g-" is short for "group")*
- *oooh-*: used to discuss and share interesting information about a topic.
- *help-*: for asking for help on specific topics.
- *at* or *koor-at*: for customer channels.

#### Slack Conventions

Conventions for using Slack:

- Use public channels whenever possible. Threads within public channels can prevent spamming people, while still allowing others to be aware of what's going on and to contribute if they have something to add.
- Posts will be considered FYI unless they mention a specific person @mention individuals to flag specifically for them
- Emoji acknowledgements are appreciated. See more on [GitLab's page](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/informal-communication/#using-emojis-to-convey-emotion).
- When communicating time in slack, prefer to specify in team's respective timezone or use UTC
- Use @Channel for announcements
- People can "browse all channels" and choose which channel to join, all internal Koor Technologies, Inc. channels are open to employees. If you would like to rename or change the name of a channel please contact your Slack Administrator
- Slack channels, even private ones, should never be used to discuss specific personnel issues, concerns, or performance. Membership in Slack channels changes over time and new members also see history; messages posted in channels therefore may at some point be visible to more people than who are included in the channel when it is written. (Personnel issues should properly be addressed in Slack DMs, email, Google Docs that are labeled with \[restricted\] and shared only with specific people, or in our Applicant Tracking System for candidates.)
- When responding in a public channel start a thread using the dialog above and to the right of the initial message. This will keep the conversation available for all to see but make fewer "unread" messages for teammates that are logging in after not checking Slack for a few days. Look for this icon:
- We can create "external" channels to improve communication with clients or external collaborators. The channel will be limited to collaborators with an invitation sent by email by our Slack administrator but open for all Koor Technologies, Inc. employees once the group is created. A list of participants should be provided and the main purpose of the channel should be specified.
- **TIP** You can create email notifications to avoid missing slack message.
- **Note**: that Koor Technologies, Inc. has a goal to have 80% of communication in public channels.

### GitHub

This is our main source code management tool. See our GitHub page for more on how to use it.

### Google Suite

Docs, Drive, Calendar, Spreadsheets

#### Google Drive

1. By default documents are viewable by everyone at the company. This means anyone with a Koor Technologies, Inc. email address can see the document if they have the link, but it will not show up in their search results.
    1. When a document should have [limited access](../communication.md#limited-access), adjust the document to Restricted. Do this by selecting Share \--\> Change under "Koor Technologies, Inc. Anyone in this group can view" \--\> Restricted from the dropdown.
2. Generally speaking, when you share a document share it with \[insert group email\]. We want to allow anyone to contribute to all company work products, and this ensures that when someone needs to access it they can. (There may be some specific cases where information or access rights need to be more restrictive, but please do it sparingly.)
3. Documents should use these prefixes: 1. \[public\] - open to everyone, even outside of dgdp 1. \[koor\] - available to all at koor (assumed if not labeled) 1. \[restricted\] - shared, but only to specific individuals. May also want to adjust the sharing settings 1. \[private\] - might be useful to put this for any files that you wish to keep to yourself.
4. To use documents that are stored in a shared drive, it is helpful to create a link to that shared drive from your personal drive. To do this:
    1. Head to [drive.google.com](https://drive.google.com/)
    2. Click on "Shared with me"
    3. Tap the name of the folder you want to add to your Google folder
    4. Click on the name of the folder
    5. Click on "Add shortcut to drive"

### Zoom

For videoconferencing and meetings.
