## Knowledge Management

### Google Drive

1. By default documents are viewable by everyone at the company. This means anyone with a Koor Technologies, Inc. email address can see the document if they have the link, but it will not show up in their search results.
    1. When a document should have [limited access](communication.md#limited-access), adjust the document to Restricted. Do this by selecting Share \--\> Change under "Koor Technologies, Inc. Anyone in this group can view" \--\> Restricted from the dropdown.
2. Generally speaking, when you share a document share it with \[insert group email\]. We want to allow anyone to contribute to all company work products, and this ensures that when someone needs to access it they can. (There may be some specific cases where information or access rights need to be more restrictive, but please do it sparingly.)
3. Documents should use these prefixes: 1. \[public\] - open to everyone, even outside of dgdp 1. \[koor\] - available to all at koor (assumed if not labeled) 1. \[restricted\] - shared, but only to specific individuals. May also want to adjust the sharing settings 1. \[private\] - might be useful to put this for any files that you wish to keep to yourself.
4. To use documents that are stored in a shared drive, it is helpful to create a link to that shared drive from your personal drive. To do this:
    1. Head to [drive.google.com](https://drive.google.com/)
    2. Click on "Shared with me"
    3. Tap the name of the folder you want to add to your Google folder
    4. Click on the name of the folder
    5. Click on "Add shortcut to drive"

### Courses

Koor Technologies, Inc. encourages team members to invest in their personal growth.

### Coursera

The company has an account with Coursera and any teammate may choose to join the company plan and take as many courses as they wish. This login is available in the OnePassword PeopleOps vault.

### LinkedIn Learning

Koor Technologies, Inc. is piloting LinkedIn Learning as an additional online course provider. Individuals can subscribe to LinkedIn Learning to take advantage of the numerous training courses. During the pilot period, the subscription is renewable monthly and can be expensed accordingly.

Speak with your line manager before setting up your LinkedIn Learning Subscription. They will provide guidance on the course priorities for your team.

Once a course is completed, LinkedIn provides a certificate. A copy of this must be shared at the end of each course. This process will be used to track utilization and therefore confirm extension after the pilot.

**Note**: you can expense your LinkedIn Premium Membership via Expensify.

### Other Learning Programs

In addition, teammates may spend up to $600 USD per year on other courses or professional certifications, so long as they are discussed with their manager in advance, they have the time available while fulfilling their work responsibilities, and relevant to their Koor Technologies, Inc. responsibilities.

We have a set of videos for training and onboarding here. Note that videos themselves are private because some of them have personal details shown in screenshots.
