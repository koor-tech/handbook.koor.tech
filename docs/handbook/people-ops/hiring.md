## Hiring a new team member

1. Reach out to CEO and CTO and give them an opportunity to meet the candidate.
2. Research compensation using [Pave](https://www.pave.com/), making sure to adjust for the cost of living where the candidate will do the work. If you're unsure of your findings, ask for help from the CEO.
3. Share the compensation information you've gathered with People Ops. They will confirm the information with the CEO and document this decision in the [compensation decisions document](#TODO) for future reference.
4. After compensation has been determined, create two documents for the candidate:
    - "Exit scenarios" spreadsheet
    - "Informal offer email" template.
    If you need these templates, reach out to People Ops on Slack, and they will provide you links that automatically create copies. Change the name of the documents accordingly (e.g., "\[candidate's name\]'s copy of exit scenarios,") and link to the exit scenarios spreadsheet from the offer email.
5. Prepare the informal offer email. You'll need to add the following information to the template:
    - Candidate's name and email address
    - Candidate's start date
    - Candidate's compensation
    - Candidate's reporting manager
    - Equity offered to the candidate (make this information a link to the candidate's exit scenarios spreadsheet)
    - Benefits (determined by the candidate's location)
6. Prepare the exit scenarios spreadsheet. Enter the percentage of equity offered to the candidate, and the spreadsheet will update to reflect this.
    **Note**: Don't play with numbers in the exit scenarios spreadsheet. The revision history is visible to the candidate, and they might misunderstand.
7. Once both documents are complete, share the offer email draft, exit scenarios copy, and a link to the compensation decision, with People Ops for confirmation.
8. After People Ops confirms that everything is correct, CEO or CTO will send the offer email. The offer email is copied directly from Google drive and sent to the candidate. When they send the offer, CEO or CTO will edit the permissions of the exit scenarios sheet and share with the candidate.
    **Note**: When hiring an international employee, Pilot.co recommends starting the hiring process a month before the new employee's start date.

### Steps after an offer is accepted

1. Once an offer is accepted in writing, reply to the candidate, CCing People Ops via his Koor Technologies, Inc. email address to introduce the candidate to him.
2. If the new team member is in the United States, People Ops will reach out to them and get any information needed (typically the new team member's home address and phone number) and send them a consulting or employment agreement through [Docusign](https://www.docusign.com/). If the new team member is an international employee or contractor, People Ops will start the hiring process in [Pilot](https://pilot.co/).
    **Note**: International contractor and employment agreements are handled by the Pilot.co when you start the hiring process.
3. For US employees/contractors After an agreement is signed and stored in the correct Google Drive folder, People Ops will start onboarding the new team member in [Gusto](https://www.gusto.com/). If the new team member is a W-2 employee, People Ops will reach out to them and schedule an I-9 verification meeting.
    **Note**: If we're hiring in a new state, we'll have to register for state taxes and unemployment. This process can be handled by Gusto. Usually.
4. Before their first day at Koor Technologies, Inc., People Ops will create a [Google Workspace account](https://admin.google.com/ac/users) for the new team member, add them to the Koor Technologies, Inc. [GitHub](https://github.com/koor-tech), create an onboarding issue task in the Koor Technologies, Inc. [Linear board](https://linear.app/koorinc/team/GEN/all), and invite them to join the Koor Technologies, Inc. Slack. If the new team member needs to purchase a work computer, People Ops will set them up with a [Brex](https://dashboard.brex.com/team/invite-user) card.
