While Koor Technologies, Inc. is a remote company, at time team members may travel to visit partners for product testing, training, relationship building, and hands on experience. To maximize the benefits of the visit and share learnings of trip across the team, the following process is followed:

- Create a trip folder and share notes on trip goal and plans
- Upload daily pictures from the visits
- Share daily learnings from the visit using a loom video with team
- Setup regular calls in the `#travel` Slack channel as optional for team to ask questions
- Add product or program ideas from the trip to Gitlab using standard or emergency escalation process

## Expenses While Traveling

1. The company will cover all work-related travel expenses. This includes lodging and meals during the part of the trip that is work-related. Depending on the distance of your travel, it can also include one day before and one day after the work related business. For example, if you are attending a 3 day conference in a jetlag-inducing location, the company will cover your lodging and meals those 3 days as well as one day before and one day after.
2. The company will cover costs related to transiting to and from a destination or airport which is work-related. This includes public transit, ride-sharing services (Lyft, Uber, etc.), or personal vehicle mileage between one's home and airport, bus/rail station, or work-related meeting.
3. The company can accommodate custom requests. It is OK to stay longer on your trip. However, the extra days will not be covered by the company.
4. Always bring a personal credit card and your corporate card with you when traveling for company business if you have one.
5. Hotels will generally expect you to have a physical credit card to present upon check-in. This credit card will be kept on file for the duration of your stay. Even if your lodging was pre-paid by the company or by using a company credit card, the Hotel may still require a card to be on file for "incidentals".
6. If you incur any work-travel related expenses (on your personal card or a Koor Technologies, Inc. company card), please make sure to save the original receipt.
7. When your trip is complete, please file an expense report via Expensify or include the receipts on your next monthly invoice.

## Travel Visas

### Arranging a visa for travel

In some cases when traveling to a conference or summit you might need to arrange a visa to enter that specific country.

Always **check the website of the Embassy of the Country you want to visit** located in your home country. They will have the most updated information on whether or not you need a visa and what is needed for your application. In some instances you can travel under a visa waiver program; in other cases you might need to arrange a tourist or business visa. Read their website carefully and ask People Ops Specialists if you need any help with acquiring the needed documents for your application.

We gladly organize and pay for local legal assistance, especially if you are at high risk of having a long process.

### Expensing

You can expense:

- Cost of the VISA
- Cost of pictures for the VISA
- Cost of a lawyer to help you with the application
- Cost of postage
- Cost of travel related COVID Tests

You can *not* expense relocation costs.
