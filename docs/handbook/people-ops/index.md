### Directly responsible individuals

At Koor Technologies, Inc. we use the concept of directly responsible individuals (DRIs), a person who is singularly responsible for a given aspect of the open source project, the product, or the company. This person is responsible for accomplishing goals and making decisions about a particular aspect of Koor Technologies, Inc.. DRIs help us collaborate efficiently by knowing exactly who is responsible, and can make decisions about the work they're doing.

| Aspect                                                             | DRI                      |

### Workstation setup

#### Spending company money

As we continue to expand our own company policies, we use [GitLab's open expense policy][16] as a guide for company spending.

In brief, this means that as a Koor Technologies, Inc. team member, you may:

- Spend company money like it is your own money.
- Be responsible for what you need to purchase or expense in order to do your job effectively.
- Feel free to make purchases in the interest of the company without asking for permission beforehand (when in doubt, do inform your manager prior to purchase, or as soon as possible after the purchase).

For more developed thoughts about spending guidelines and limits, please read [GitLab's open expense policy][16].

#### Purchasing a company-issued device.

Koor Technologies, Inc. provides laptops for team members to use while working at Koor Technologies, Inc.. As soon as an offer is accepted, eashaw will reach out to the new team member to start this process. eashaw will work with the new team member to get their laptop purchased and shipped to them.

Most of the team at Koor Technologies, Inc. use 16" MacBook Pros, but team members are free to choose any laptop or operating system that works for them, as long as the price [is within reason][17].

When selecting your new laptop, we ask that you optimize your configuration to have a large hard drive and be available for delivery or pickup quickly, without waiting for customization.

When a device has been purchased, it's added to the [spreadsheet of company equipment][18] where we keep track of devices and equipment purchased by Koor Technologies, Inc.. When the team member receives their computer, they will complete the entry by adding a description, model, and serial number to the spreadsheet.

You need to have a good workstation to work from home to be a productive contributor at Koor Technologies, Inc.. Full-time teammates may use company money to purchase [office equipment and supplies][19], as they do at GitLab. (Part time teammates or contractors should ask their manager before making purchases.) We mostly follow the guidelines described in their policies, though one important distinction is that within Koor Technologies, Inc., purchases exceeding $500 USD are company property and required to be tracked in the [Employee Equipment - Fixed Asset Tracking sheet][20]. There's a link below that provides details on reasonable prices for items on the list, and look at our [finance page][21] for instructions on how to file expenses.

#### Required setup

The following setup is required for all teammates:

- Computer \-- see [laptop purchase and setup][22] from GitLab. We recommend [Apple MacBook Pro 14", 512 GB][23] for non-engineers and [Apple MacBook Pro 16"][24] for engineers. Team members may refresh their laptop every 36 months. Please submit your Apple purchase request to \[Add Company Name Here\] ***If you're new to Macbook, please visit our*** ***[Knowledge Management][25] page in the handbook to learn the new operating system***.
- [Camera][26] for videoconferences
- [Light][27] that makes your face visible on videoconference calls
- High-speed, reliable internet
- Power source, if it's not reliable in your area. We recommend solar power as it is efficient.
- Quality [headset][28] with microphone for videoconferences **or** [external mic][29] and [headphones][30] combo (up to personal preference).
GitLab offers guidelines on [reasonable prices][31] and recommendations on specific pieces of hardware.

#### Recommended hardware

These items are highly encouraged:

- [LG Monitor][32]
- Upgraded webcam \-- something better than what comes with your laptop, and that can be mounted on your monitor
- Comfortable, [ergonomic chair][33]
- [Adjustible height desk][34], or a [standing desk converter][35]

We recommend you consider these items:

- [Mouse][36] and [keyboard][37]
- Coworking space
- Office decorations that help you feel productive or look good on Zoom
- Wifi router
- Android phone
- Internet connectivity
- Google Voice - US-based phone numbers are available to all employees if needed, or need to register a phone number with external parties but don't want to share your personal line. Please request Gvoice account from People Ops via the #peopleops Slack channel.
Note that internet connectivity may be expensed if it is used primarily for business and local law permits us to pay for it without incurring taxes. We recommend you aim for at least 10Mbps, but that you make relevant cost / bandwidth tradeoffs based on your local area. Expenses should be submitted monthly using our [expense guidelines][21].

#### Recommended Power backup

To avoid interruptions when there is no electricity, this is a setup we recommend using:

- 100 Watts Solar panel
- 500VA - 1000va Hybrid inverter
- 100AH 12V Battery

#### Shipping hardware from the U.S. to Africa

We recommend using the following parcel forwarding services:

- [Heroshe][38]: to ship goods from the U.S. to Nigeria.
- [iShop Worldwide][39]: to ship goods from U.S. or the U.K. to Zambia or Nigeria.
For both platforms, the process is as followed:

1. Sign up to the platform.
2. Order items to the warehouse address indicated on the respective websites.
3. Pay the shipping fees to platform.
4. Receive items in Nigeria or Zambia.

For warranty reasons, we recommend buying directly from the manufacturer rather than platforms such as Amazon.

- Swiping up on the trackpad with two fingers is scroll.
- Swiping up on the trackpad with three fingers allows you to see all open windows.
- "Two-finger push upward" makes the page scroll down.

- Be aware of ["Hot Corners"][41] \-- this can be startling if you're not used to it

#### Keyboard commands:

- Command + C = copy
- Command + V = paste
- Command + X = cut
- Command + Shift
