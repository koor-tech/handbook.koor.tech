## Authenticity

Why should you be authentic?
Everyone has their own skills and ways of doing things.

Being honest with ourselves and our customers to build a relationship that can accept
Trust. Being clear on what we can do for each other.
Freedom to bring innovation, ideas and change on the table for improvement.

## Empowerment

* Thinking in the Open - Empower yourself, colleagues and customers by thinking in the open.
* We need to share our experiences and knowledge openly with each other to empower ourselves in our goal of helping our customers and the communities.
* Taking Ownership Of Problems And Situations
    Empower yourself by owning up to failure but also success, transparent to the customer.
* Empowering the whole team and not just "a single person"

## Transparency

Be transparent (and vocal) about feedback and problems to the customers, colleagues and yourself.

Transparency to yourself and others on, e.g., how long will you need to finish a task.
