### Voluntary Separation

A voluntary separation occurs when a team member informs his or her manager of a resignation. The choice to leave Koor Technologies, Inc. was their decision.

If you are a current team member and you are thinking about resigning from Koor Technologies, Inc., we encourage you to speak with your manager, or another trusted team member to discuss your reasons for wanting to leave. At Koor Technologies, Inc. we want to ensure that all issues team members are facing are discussed and resolved before a resignation decision has been made. This will allow Koor Technologies, Inc. the ability to address concerns and in return foster a great work environment.

If resignation is the only solution after you have discussed your concerns, please communicate your intention to resign to your manager. We would advise you to review your employment contract for the statutory notice period and determine your last working day. Then with your manager you can discuss the time needed to work on a handover/transition. If there's no notice period included in your employment contract we would advise that you provide Koor Technologies, Inc. 2 weeks of notice. Hereafter please review the below process which will be followed for a voluntary resignation.

#### Voluntary Process

1. **Team Member**: Team members are requested to provide an agreed upon notice of their intention to separate from the company to allow a reasonable amount of time to transfer ongoing workloads.
2. **Team Member**: The team member should provide a written resignation letter or email notification to their manager.
3. **Manager**: Create an Offboarding ticket

### Involuntary Separation

Involuntary offboarding of any team member is never easy; however, it is a reality that we will encounter from time to time. Not every team member hired will be the right fit for what the company needs; as unpleasant as involuntary separation may be, it is better than allowing a person to languish in a position where they are not succeeding. What's important is to treat the situation with dignity and respect for the people involved. Below are our guidelines on how to approach this.

An involuntary separation may be the appropriate course of action if the team member is unwilling or unable to perform at the level required of their role. In most cases this will be a culmination of the process of managing underperformance, and a series of remediations should be considered prior to taking this approach. Team members should not be surprised by an involuntary separation for underperformance -- their manager should have provided a written warning or actionable performance improvement plan well in advance.

It may also be appropriate if the company needs shift or scale and a team member is unable to adapt. Before embarking on separation, in most cases we will look for alternative ways for the team member to contribute. Shifts and changes can be great opportunities to learn new skills or explore other interests, or even take on new roles. This kind of adaptation can be more difficult when someone holds a unique role within the company (e.g. "CEO" or "Head of..."), but even in these situations we want to try to retain a great contributor if possible.

In either of the above cases, and if the manager believes the team member has been acting in good faith, Koor Technologies, Inc. policy is to offer a severance payment of six weeks for team members who have served for nine months or more.

Some other situations where involuntary separation be appropriate include unethical, dishonest, or illegal behavior, making other team members or customers feel unsafe in their work environments, or major strategic shifts in company strategy or financial position. These will be evaluated on a case by case basis.

#### Process for involuntary separation

Should a manager decide that involuntary separation is the appropriate course of action, they must follow the process below. There are a variety of goals to achieve in the process, including treating the affected team member(s) with dignity and respect, minimizing disruption to company operations, and fulfilling legal and ethical obligations.

If the need for Involuntary offboarding arises, the manager must follow this process:

1. Obtain CEO approval, and notify peopleops
2. Share the news with the team member over videoconference, with a peopleops representative present
3. Disconnect accounts, with support from peopleops
4. Share the news with the affected member's team
5. Share the news with the rest of the company
6. Follow procedures from the standard offboarding process

A few notes on the process:

1. It's highly recommended by nearly all HR specialists that company accounts are disconnected immediately after notifying a team member of an involuntary separation. This stems from cybersecurity concerns, and Koor Technologies, Inc. will abide by this practice by default. However, on a case by case basis, a manager may offer to pass along a note from the team member with new contact information.
2. Given the asynchronous nature of work at Koor Technologies, Inc., it's inevitable that many team members will hear about the news first through email. We will embrace this -- it's better to communicate the news right away and schedule a followup videoconference for Q&A than to try to "manage" its rollout at the expense of creating rumors for hours before a team may have the opportunity to convene.
3. In addition to these company policies, Koor Technologies, Inc. will adhere to any applicable labor laws for the country in which the team member resides.

### Company Assets - Laptop

If the team member has completed 1 calendar year or more at Koor Technologies, Inc. at the time of offboarding, they can opt to keep their laptop at no cost. If the team member hasn't completed 1 calendar year at the time of offboarding or has received a laptop refresh within the past year, they have the option to purchase their laptop for current market value from Koor Technologies, Inc.
