This handbook page includes information about our brand, and guidelines on using our name and logo externally.

## Name

The name of our company is 'Koor Technologies, Inc.'. We use 'Koor' or 'Koor.Tech' as a shortcut - but be careful to use this only when in a context where it is clear that you are referring to Koor Technologies, Inc.

Incorrect usage:

- "Koor Technologies" X
- "Koortechnologies inc" X
- "koor" X

Correct Usage:

- Koor Technologies, Inc. ✓
- Koor.Tech ✓

## Do we brand our product?

We include a "Powered by Koor Technologies, Inc." tag in the Koor Storage Distribution, but want all branding to focus on our customers' communities. There are enough new concepts for residents of new cities to grapple with, and explaining "who is Koor Technologies, Inc." is not something we want to introduce into the equation at this point. Better for people to associate our application on the innovation of the community itself.

We should think of our brand as important to companies in need of storage for their applications. This community is small enough that we do not think it's necessary to have a consumer facing brand.

## Sprint Updates

At the end of each sprint, C-Level posts an update to a variety of social media channels. Here is the process:

1. Videos from each teammate are complete by AM on the Wednesday of the sprint end. See demo process for details on this.
2. Confirm that all videos are compiled in a YouTube playlist titled Progress Updates YYYY-MM-DD
3. Add C-Level video as first video in playlist; reorder the others roughly with the most important / informative updates nearest the top
4. Post the video and 1-2 highlights to Twitter from the [@koor_tech](https://twitter.com/koor_tech) account. Add \# and #remotework hashtags.
5. C-Level retweets from his personal account and \[EA:\] using Hootsuite (in the future), schedules the same post in our other media channels: including LinkedIn: Koor Technologies, Inc., and Twitter: Koor Technoliges, Inc..

## Sprint Update Video Guidelines

!!! note
    Currently we are not publishing sprint update videos.

1. Deadlines:
    1. All individual-contributor (IC) videos are due by **end of day Tuesday** local time, unless your manager has set an earlier deadline
    2. All manager videos are due by **Wednesday 12p (noon) Pacific time**
    3. C-Level video is due by 9:30p Pacific Time
2. All IC videos should be 2 minutes or less, and cover what work you completed in this sprint. Manager videos should be 5 minutes or less. (Times are not strictly enforced, e.g. going 2m10s is fine, but 3 minutes should be a sign that you're covering too much.)
3. Each video should have the person's name, or role if preferred, and the date in its title. Remember that dates should be in yyyy-mm-dd format
4. All team members should add their videos to the week's playlist. The first person to publish the video may need to create the playlist, titled Progress Updates YYYY-MM-DD
5. Videos should not include any user PII or customer names for which we don't have explicit permission. If inadvertently shared or shown in a screenshot, either re-record the video or mark it as private.
6. For engineers: front-end features should be shown on production and in mobile view. Back-end features should show code snippets or handbook documentation.
7. For non-engineers: accomplishments or learnings should be shared rather than that an event took place. e.g. "We trained 5 users and they were able to complete xyz (or had difficulty with abc)" is much better than "we completed a training"
8. Heads of Departments will include a one-slide update on OKRs on each sprint update
